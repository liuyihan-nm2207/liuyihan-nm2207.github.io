    <p>Singapore, like many countries in the world, is facing a demographic shift. With both fertility and mortality rates declining, Singapore's young population is declining year by year, while the number of middle-aged and elderly people is increasing annually. According to the World Bank, the age dependency ratio in Singapore has arrived 35.35 % in 2021. This means that young people are under more pressure to support the elderly. Without intervention, this ratio will continue to increase in the future, which puts a huge financial and psychological burden on young people and hinders socio-economic development. </p>
    <p>Therefore, I intend to design a data story to show my audience the current demographic situation of Singapore, the changes it has undergone in recent decades, and its major problems. I hope that my data story will raise more people's awareness on the demographic issues.</p>

      <p>In 2020, the population of Singapore stands at 5.45 million. Of these 5.45 million people, 4 million are residents, consisting of 3.5 million citizens and 500,000 permanent residents (PRs). The remaining 1.45 million people living in Singapore are classed as non-residents, a group consisting mainly of foreign students and individuals on work passes.</p>

      <p>The Sex Ratio in Singapore in 2020 is 109.82 males per 100 females. There are 3.09 million males and 2.81 million females in Singapore. The percentage of female population is 47.66% compare to 52.34% male population. Singapore has 0.28 million more males than females.</p>

      <p>With low fertility rates and longer life expectancies, Singapore’s population is ageing
        rapidly. The proportion of citizens aged 65 and above has increased from 11.1% in 2010
        to 18.4% in 2020. It is note worthy that the world average proportion of population ages 65 and above is only about 9%.</p>
        <p>What causes Singapore's disproportionately high rate of ageing population? We will take this question into Part 2.</p>

          <p>The chart above shows that Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) is not only lower than that of nearby countries, but also well below the world rate. And this has led to negative population growth.</p>

                 </div>
                 <p>The chart illustrates that Singapore's population growth slows down from 2010 onwards and suddenly drops below 0 by 2020. This means that new births or new immigrants are no longer able to offset the death or out-migration of the population.</p>

        <p>Declining fertility rates and negative population growth have led to an increasing skewed population in Singapore: the proportion of seniors is growing while the proportion of young people is declining, resulting in a top-heavy demographic structure. And this demographic structure has put considerable pressure on both the pension system and the economic development of Singapore society. It will be a serious challenge for Singapore to face.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Parents in Sweden are entitled to 480 days of paid parental leave when a child is born or adopted. Each parent – should they be two – is entitled to 240 of those days. If the child is born in 2016 or later, each parent has 90 days reserved exclusively for him/her. Should he/she decide not to take these, they can’t be transferred to the partner. A single parent is entitled to a full 480 days.</p><br>

    </p><br>
    <p class="w3-text-grey"> 61.65% in 2021.
    </p><br>
      

    </div>  
    <p>Sweden’s efforts to achieve gender equality have paid off to quite an extent. The higher female labor force participation to some extent justifies this fact. I think one of the main reasons for Singapore's low total fertility rate is that the government does not provide women with a sufficiently gender-equitable childbirth policy. As we can see from the table above, new fathers in Singapore are allowed to choose whether to take parental leave or not, rather than being mandated to do so like new fathers in Sweden. This is likely to result in all parental leave being taken by new mothers, thus resulting in the main burden of childcare being allocated to women. To address the low willingness to have children due to gender inequality in the family, I think Singapore could try to further introduce and adapt the Swedish fertility policy into Singaporean society. This may be able to change the low fertility rate in Singapore in the future and improve the general demographic structure of Singapore.</p>
