<h1> The Changes of Population Structure in Singapore </h1>

<p> </p>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<div> Singapore, like many countries in the world, is facing a demographic shift. With both fertility and mortality rates declining, Singapore's young population is declining year by year, while the number of middle-aged and elderly people is increasing annually. According to the World Bank, the age dependency ratio in Singapore has arrived 35.35 % in 2021. This means that young people are under more pressure to support the elderly. Without intervention, this ratio will continue to increase in the future, which puts a huge financial and psychological burden on young people and hinders socio-economic development.

Therefore, I intend to design a data story to show my audience the current demographic situation of Singapore, the changes it has undergone in recent decades, and its major problems. I hope that my data story will raise more people's awareness on the demographic issues.

<div> (Now this part is not finished yet. In my final version I will link each year's population pyramid to a position on the bar. In this way, when audiences drag the bar, they can feel more directly that the bottom of the pyramid is narrowing while the middle and upper part is widening, which represents the shrinking of the young population and the gradual increase of the old population.)
